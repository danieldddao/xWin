# xWin
Using C# and .Net framework

## Windows program that would enable using a XBox360 controller in place of a keyboard and mouse.

The user can use their XBox360 controller to do a google search, launch their favorite programs, chat with a friend, copy and paste notes into a document, or anything else that a keyboard and mouse could do without having to constantly switch between holding a controller and using the keyboard and mouse.
